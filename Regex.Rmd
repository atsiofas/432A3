## Importing the Dataset
```{r}
library(dplyr)
MData <- read_csv("~/OneDrive - Queen's University/BIOL 432/measurements.csv")
head(MData)
```
## Adding Sp Column

An abbreviated species column is added to the dataset then replaces the Organism column as the first column in a new object called NData
```{r}
NData <- MData %>% 
  mutate(Sp = sub("(\\w)\\w+", "\\1.", Organism)) %>% #replacing the genus name with the first letter and a period
  select(Sp, Limb.width, Limb.length, Observer) #rearranging the columns and replacing Organism with Sp as the first column
head(NData)
```
## Saving the Dataset
```{r}
write.csv(NData, "MeasShort.csv")
```
